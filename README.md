Slither is an application designed to track the movement of C. elegan worms in a
laboratory environment. You can either use video footage you've already captured
from your dissection microscope camera, or you can allow Slither to capture new
footage for you.

It was developed under the Small Neural Systems Group of Dr. Catharine Rankin at
the Brain Research Centre located at the University of British Columbia.

Slither is released under the GNU General Public License version 3 or later.
