Slither is an application designed to track the movement of C. elegan worms in a
laboratory environment. You can either use video footage you've already captured
from your dissection microscope camera, or you can allow Slither to capture new
footage for you.

It is being developed under the Small Neural Systems Group of Catharine Rankin,
Ph.D., at the Brain Research Centre located at the University of British 
Columbia.

Slither is released under the GNU General Public License and is available for
Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. Accessibility is important, and thus porting to
other operating systems is encouraged.
